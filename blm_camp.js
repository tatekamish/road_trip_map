Located 400 miles from Anchorage, the village of Unalakleet has approximately 800 people and is accessible only by plane.\r\n\r\nThe headwaters of the Unalakleet River originate in the Nulato Hills.  These rolling hills divide rainfall and snow melt between Norton Sound and the Yukon River basin.  At this point, the river is swift and channelized; once it reaches the valley floor it begins to meander.  For most of its length, the river has a varying pool/riffle nature, which offers a great diversity of river characteristics, boating opportunities, and fishing opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe area’s remote location in Western Alaska means that visitors are unlikely to meet other recreationists while on their journey.  However, travelers will likely encounter local fishermen and other local travelers in power boats along the lower reaches of the river.\r\n\r\nKALTAG PORTAGE\r\nThe Unalakleet River is located within the Kaltag Portage, which has been an important route for travel, transportation, and trade between Norton Sound and Interior Alaska for thousands of years.  It served as a vital link between the Iсupiat and Yup’ik of the coast, and the Yukon River and Athabascan groups in the Interior.  During the period of Alaskan development, the Kaltag Portage was used as a route for both the historic Iditarod Trail and the Washington-Alaska Military Cable and Telegraph System (WAMCATS).\r\n\r\nCLIMATE\r\nThe name Unalakleet is an Iсupiaq word meaning “place where the east wind blows.”  Summer temperatures average from 40° to 60°F.  Rain is common throughout the summer and varies between a light mist and a heavy downpour.  Weather conditions can change quickly and summer storms can cause water levels to rise rapidly, creating potential flooding hazards.\r\n\r\nCAMPING\r\nThere are no established campsites or public facilities along the river corridor.  The Unalakleet National Wild River corridor ends at its confluence with the Chirosky River, 24 river miles upstream from the village of Unalakleet.  In the wild river corridor and below the Chirosky River, there are individual Native allotments which are private.  Contact the Unalakleet Native Corporation for permission to camp on Alaska Native lands below the Chirosky River.\r\n\r\nFISHING\r\nFishing is excellent for Coho, Chum, and Pink salmon.  Arctic grayling and Dolly Varden are also plentiful.\r\n\r\nSUMMER RECREATION\r\nThe Unalakleet River supports such activities as fishing, boating, and camping. The best time to visit is July through mid-September to take full advantage of the midnight sunshine and discover what is considered to be one of the greatest salmon runs in Alaska.\r\n\r\nWINTER RECREATION\r\nThe frozen Unalakleet River comes alive in winter with the joyful cries of sled dogs as the historic Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race parallels the frozen river en route to the finish line in Nome. Popular winter activities along the river corridor include snowmobiling, dog mushing, ice fishing, hunting and trapping.\r\n\r\nRESOURCE MANAGEMENT\r\nThe upper 81 river miles of the Unalakleet are designated a National Wild River and administered by the Bureau of Land Management. A \"wild river\" is free of impoundments, generally inaccessible except by trail, with primitive watersheds and shorelines, and has unpolluted waters. The BLM manages the Unalakleet National Wild River to provide high-quality primitive recreation opportunities, protect water quality, protect historic and archaeological values, and preserve the remarkable fisheries resources for which the river was designated.\r\n", "RecAreaDirections": "The Unalakleet River is located in the northwestern part of Alaska and drains into Norton Sound.

Excavations were conducted by the University of Arizona from 1966 to 1971. People first arrived in this area 11,000 years ago. They belonged to what we now call the Clovis Culture and were the earliest known people to have inhabited North America. Named after the distinctive and beautifully crafted Clovis spear points they made, they were expert hunters of the large mammals of the last Ice Age.

The river begins in the Alaska Range near Summit Lake and flows south into the Copper River, which eventually empties into the Gulf of Alaska between Cordova and Katalla. Several hundred lakes and ponds are scattered throughout the spruce-dominated forest of the Gulkana River watershed, providing abundant nesting areas for trumpeter swans and waterfowl. <p> Portions of the Gulkana River were designated for its wild character as part of the National Wild and Scenic River system. The BLM asks that all users do their part to help maintain the wild character of the Gulkana through low impact camping techniques. <p> <span style=\"font-weight : bold;\"> Seasons and Climate </span> <p> The Gulkana River running season generally begins in early to mid-June, depending on ice breakup and precipitation. Average annual precipitation is 11 inches of rain and 48 inches of snow. July is commonly the wettest month. Summer temperatures range from 35 F to occasional highs in the 80s. Be prepared for cold, wet weather at any time. By mid-September, shorter days and colder temperatures bring the river-running season to a quick end. <p> <span style=\"font-weight : bold;\"> History and Prehistory </span> <p> The initial seven-mile stretch of the Middle Fork of the Gulkana River is within the Tangle Lakes Archaeological District. This area is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Several known prehistoric sites are located within the corridor. The Ahtna Indians were the earliest known humans to use the Gulkana River. Around 1910, miners used the West Fork and the Middle Fork routes to reach the Denali Mining District, about 80 air-miles to the west. <span style=\"font-weight : bold;\"> NOTE: Collection or disturbance of any historic or prehistoric remains is against the law. </span> <p> <span style=\"font-weight : bold;\"> Vegetation and Wildlife </span> <p> <p> Spruce-hardwood forest is the major vegetation type along the Gulkana River. You may see white and black spruce, birch, aspen and popular forests. The understory includes willow, alder, rose, dwarf birch, cranberry, blueberry, Labrador tea, dwarf dogwood, lichens and mosses. <p> Depending on location, you may see grizzly bear, black bear, moose, caribou, beaver, coyote, otter, bald eagles, kingfishers, and assorted waterfowl. There are more than 33 species of mammals and 59 species of birds known to live in the Gulkana River basin. <p> <span style=\"font-weight : bold;\"> Fish </span> <p> The Gulkana River's abundant fish makes it one of the most popular sportfishing rivers in Alaska. Its tributaries contain rainbow trout/steelhead, arctic grayling, king salmon (chinook), red salmon (sockeye), whitefish, longnose suckers, and lamprey. The surrounding lakes have good populations of lake trout, burbot and whitefish. <p> You can purchase an Alaska fishing license and view sportfishing regulations online at the <a href=\"http://www.adfg.state.ak.us\">Alaska Department of Fish and Game</a> website or buy in person from license agents throughout the state, including stores in Glennallen, Delta Junction and Tok.

The river begins at not much more than a trickle at an elevation of about 8,000 feet in the Sawtooth and Whitecloud Mountains of central Idaho. It gathers force as it makes its way northeast and then west, fed by snows from the Sawtooth and Salmon River Mountains in the south and the Clearwater and Bitterroot Mountains in the north.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About 150 miles further on its westward course, the Salmon River has carved the second deepest canyon in North America, which effectively splits Idaho in half. The section known as the Lower Salmon River begins at Vinegar Creek, 25 miles above the town of Riggins. At Riggins, the river swings north and then west for 87 miles where it then meets the Snake River. The Salmon and Snake combine to flow into the Columbia River and eventually into the ocean. The drainage area of the Salmon River, which lies entirely within Idaho's borders, encompasses approximately 13,550 square miles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The river and its canyon are truly remarkable in this \"pool and drop\" river where difficult rapids are located in the narrow canyons. The numerous unusual white sand beaches offer camping and serve as a reminder that this river is still free flowing. The 20-mile stretch of the Snake River, from the confluence with the Salmon River to the Heller Bar take-out near the confluence with the Grande Ronde River, contains slower moving water with some rapids and is often characterized by stiff up-canyon winds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Along the Lower Salmon River, the BLM manages the following sites: Hammer Creek, Island Bar, Lucile, Old Lucile, Pine Bar, Shorts Bar, Skookumchuck, Slate Creek and White Bird Gravel Pit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lower Salmon River from Vinegar Creek to the confluence with the Snake River features 112 miles of Class II-IV whitewater in one of the deepest canyons in the United States. Much of the 53 miles of the river, from White Bird downstream to the confluence of the Snake and Salmon Rivers, is roadless and accessible only by boat. The Lower Salmon is a suitable river for future Wild and Scenic River designation. The BLM recreation sites with provide access to the Lower Salmon are Island Bar, Lucile, Old Lucile, Shorts Bar, Slate Creek, Skookumchuck, White Bird, Hammer Creek and Pine Bar.

Congress established the NCA in 2000 to conserve, protect, and enhance resources associated with the California National Historic Trail and surrounding areas including the 10 designated wilderness areas. Not only does the NCA contain fascinating cultural, archaeological, and paleontological traces of the past, but it also offers a rugged brand of recreation activities for today's adventurers. What these million-plus acres lack in developed amenities, they offer in unique and challenging backcountry and wilderness opportunities. The longest intact segments (totaling 175 miles) of the historic Emigrant Trails to California and Oregon is located within the NCA. <p>\n \n<h2>Geology</h2></p>The NCA's geologic features tell a tale of astounding natural forces. The Black Rock Desert playa—a flat expanse of about 200 square miles—once formed the bed of Lake Lahontan, an ancient lake that covered much of northwestern Nevada 15,000 years ago. Today the playa is favored by off-roaders, land sailers, and amateur rocketry groups, and it provides a dramatic venue for large, outdoor events. The area's namesake, a distinctive formation of black rock, is an impressive outcropping of volcanic rocks and limestone. <p>\n \n<h2>History</h2></p>American Indians inhabited Black Rock - High Rock country for at least 10,000 years before Euro-American emigrants passed through on their way to California and Oregon in the 19th century. Black Rock Point was a welcome landmark for these settlers. In 1843—44 the famous explorer John C. Frémont traversed what is now the Applegate Trail, pioneering a throughway from which many wagon routes would form. Visitors today can walk along the Applegate and Nobles trails and read signs depicting diary entries from the early emigrants. <p>\n\n<h2>Recreational Opportunities</h2></p>Variety of recreational opportunities are present within the NCA suitable for visitors of all experience levels, such as: <ul><li>Off-Roading and Land-Sailing on the Black Rock Desert Playa.</li> <li>Historic and wildlife sightseeing along the Emigrant Trail.</li> <li>Camping dispersedly or at Soldier Meadows Campground.</li> <li>Camping and star-gazing at one of the cowboy cabins at Steven's Camp, Massacre Ranch, or Soldier Meadows.</li> <li>Commercial, competitive, and organized events and activities occur in the NCA through the Special Recreation Permit (SRP) Program. For more information on SRPs, please visit the <a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/programs/recreation/permits-and-passes/special-recreation-permits/nevada\">Nevada SRP Page.</a></li> </ul> <h2>Information</h2></p>Please remember this area is rugged and remote, and visitors need to be prepared for backcountry travel with no cell phone signal and few, if any, other people nearby. Black Rock country is a land of extremes—the weather can be hot and sunny one day and cold and snowy the next. Visitors should be prepared for changing weather conditions and carry additional water, food, and clothing. <p>\n\n</p>High-clearance vehicles with off-road tires (at least 6-ply) are recommended, as is a second spare tire for visitors who plan to travel the dirt roads in and around the NCA.

You cannot always depend on a signpost or a ranger to get you out of a fix. Bring appropriate equipment so you can be prepared for weather changes and can take care of yourself, if necessary, overnight.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Do not recreate alone</strong>. Or leave an activity plan with friends, family, or a ranger that detail where you will be and when you expect to return.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Have a communication plan</strong>. Cellphones do not get signal in all parts on the National Monument; a radio, personal locator beacon, satellite phone, or signaling mirror can be crucial in a time of need.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Carry and drink as much water as you can</strong>. At least one gallon per person per day is recommended. When half of your water is gone, turn around and head back.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Protect yourself from the sun</strong>. Dress in layers, Wear a hat, sunglasses, protective clothing, and sturdy footwear. Use sunscreen. Bring warm layers and a waterproof shell on longer hikes – the weather can change quickly.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Know your trail</strong>. Carry a map and pay attention to the terrain so you can find your way back.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Beware of dangerous flora and fauna</strong>. Watch where you put your hands and feet. Cacti, ocotillo, rattlesnakes, and bees (to name a few) may pose danger to visitors.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Keep children near you and stay on the trail</strong>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Recreation</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>To help you decide which of the many trails to take – especially if you’re a newcomer – we have divided the National Monument into three areas: the<a href=\"/sites/blm.gov/files/programs-nlcs-ca-santa-rosa-san-jacinto-national-monument-hiking-SanJac.pdf\"> San Jacinto Mountains</a> west of Palm Canyon divide, the <a href=\"/sites/blm.gov/files/programs-nlcs-ca-santa-rosa-san-jacinto-national-monument-hiking-NSR.pdf\">Northern Santa Rosa Mountains </a>between the Palm Canyon divide and Highway 74, and the <a href=\"/sites/blm.gov/files/programs-nlcs-ca-santa-rosa-san-jacinto-national-monument-hiking-SSR.pdf\">Southern Santa Rosa Mountains </a>from Highway 74 to the Monument’s border with Anza Borrego Desert State Park.

When assessing how difficult a trail may be for you, consider whether you plan to return on the same trail, thereby doubling your distance, or by using another trail which also adds mileage and difficulty. Be aware that using two moderate trails to complete a loop may result in a strenuous hike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best time of year for enjoying lower elevation trails is November through April;&nbsp;for higher elevation trails, the best time is May through October.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many trails are open to all forms of non-motorized travel – hiking, horseback riding, and mountain biking – but not all trails are open to everyone. Mountain bikers are prohibited in designated wilderness areas, in the Indian Canyons, on certain trails near Murray Hill, or on any part of the <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5353107.html\">Pacific Crest Trail</a>.

In the San Jacinto Mountains, which are usually accessed via the Palm Springs Aerial Tramway or from the alpine community of Idyllwild, dogs are prohibited in Mount San Jacinto State Park and Wilderness. Dogs are also prohibited in the Indian Canyons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Dog Friendly Areas:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the limited opportunities for taking your dog on mountain trails in the Monument is available on the loop connecting Homme Adams and Cahuilla Hills Parks in the City of Palm Desert. From Homme Adams Park, follow the Homestead Trail to the Hopalong Cassidy Trail, then south on the “Hoppy” to the cross or north to the Gabby Hayes which will take you down to Cahuilla Hills Park, or viceversa.

In some areas, the BLM lands are intermingled with State of Montana lands and private property. The monument designation applies only to the BLM-managed lands.<p/>\r\n\r\n<p>The land and the rugged, surrounding uplands (commonly call the Missouri Breaks) are defined in part by their history. The entire region was the homeland and lifeblood of American Indians. The river served as the pathway for Lewis and Clark, then the waterway for steamboats and an attraction for fur trappers and traders. Later, the river and the Missouri Breaks were sanctuaries for desperados trying to stay a step ahead of the law. The land was also a source of hope and inspiration for several generations of homesteaders.<p/>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, the public lands in the monument make a significant contribution to the local lifestyle and the regional economy.

Totaling more than 360 river miles, it may be the longest road-to-road float in North America. </p>\r\n<p>Beaver Creek runs through a remote area of interior Alaska. Most floaters begin in the Nome Creek valley, near the Ophir Creek Campground.  If launching here, take note:  boat motors are limited to 15 horsepower or less. Once you put in at Nome Creek, there are no roads or services until you reach the bridge on the Dalton Highway. It usually takes six days to reach the mouth of Victoria Creek at river mile 111. Many floaters pre-arrange for a Fairbanks air-taxi service to pick them up from a gravel bar a few miles past Victoria Creek. If you continue down Beaver Creek and the Yukon River to the Dalton Highway bridge, you should plan for up to two additional weeks of travel.</p>\r\n<p>Many gravel bars along the river provide great camping. Also the Borealis-LeFevre Cabin at river mile 32 is also available by reservation (check the link below for more information about cabin rentals). Use dead and down wood for campfires and pack out any trash. The BLM supports Leave No Trace camping techniques., so please remove any trace of your camp, such as fire rings, and scatter any firewood piles.</p>\r\n<p>Wind, rain, and freezing temperatures have weathered away the surrounding rock to expose the jagged cliffs and peaks seen along Beaver Creek. These high ridges are home to Dall sheep and peregrine falcons. Along the creeks, the gravel soils support tall white spruce trees and dense brush that line the banks. Eagles, peregrine falcon, and owls hunt the river corridor. Migratory waterfowl, such as mergansers, shovelheads, goldeneyes, and harlequins spend the summers along Beaver Creek. Known for its large dorsal fin, the Arctic grayling is the predominant fish species in the White Mountains. Other types of fish include northern pike, sheefish, burbot, and salmon. </p>\r\n<h2>Monitoring River Levels</h2><p>A stream gauge on Nome Creek near by Ophir Creek Campground provides useful information for monitoring Beaver Creek floating conditions. Using GOES satellite telemetry, water stage, water temperature, air temperature, and cumulative precipitation are recorded at 15-minute intervals. Current observations are available on the National Weather Service’s Hydrometeorological Automated Data System (HADS) website (https://hads.ncep.noaa.gov/charts/AK.shtml).</p> <p>To view the data, find station NOCA2 (Nome Creek above Beaver Creek) in the list, select a time interval, and press “Decoded Data” to view the tables and graphs of observations.</p> <p> For those interested in floating Beaver Creek, look at the River Height (HG) data for current river stage conditions.  Stage of less than 2 feet is very low flow, meaning difficult floating, especially for rafts. Stage of 2.5 feet is moderate flow -- good float conditions. Stage of 2.75 to 3 feet or above is considered high water; be prepared for fast current, floating logs, flooded campsites, and potentially dangerous conditions.</p><br/> \r\n<h2>Winter Activities</h2><p> Beaver Creek Wild and Scenic River also offers many winter activities for those wanting a primitive backcountry experience. Snowmobiling, dog mushing, trapping, and cross-country skiing are popular winter activities along the frozen river, which can be reached via the White Mountain National Recreation Area’s 240-mile network of groomed winter trails and public use cabins. </p>\r\n", "RecAreaDirections": "Most floaters launch from the access in the Nome Creek Valley near the Ophir Creek Campground.

The Wilderness is located in the southeast portion of the San Bernardino Mountains on lands administered by the San Bernardino National Forest and the Bureau of Land Management.</p>\r\n\r\n<drupal-entity data-align=\"left\" data-embed-button=\"embed_image\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.wysiwyg_embed\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"f6698c2b-cf20-4000-a9b3-c6a94709c030\" data-langcode=\"en\"></drupal-entity>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the Wilderness is above the 7,000 foot level. Two rivers (which would be called creeks anywhere but in Southern California), the Santa Ana and the White, flow out of the Wilderness. The numerous streams in the Wilderness Area do not always flow in late summer, and locating water can be difficult. Two small lakes, several meadows, and large, heavily forested areas provide a beautiful sub-alpine oasis in the dry lands that surround the mountain range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The isolated environment contains many threatened and endangered plant and animal species, as well as bear, deer, mountain lions and bighorn sheep. The summit of the 10,624-foot San Bernardino Peak provided the initial point in 1852 from which all of Southern California was surveyed. There are over 20 miles of the Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail in the BLM portion and 81 miles of trails in the National Forest portion of the Wilderness.&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "RecAreaDirections": "Riverside and San Bernardino Counties; 2 miles north of Morongo Valley and approximately 10 miles northwest of Palm Springs, California.

Laced with deep washes and shallow drainages, the area supports a variety of riparian streams which flow year-round. Here, desert and mountain environments blend together to form unique plant habitats, which thrive in riparian oases. The Santa Rosas are strewn with boulders. The steep canyon walls have been eroded by springs and streams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bear Creek Oasis, Lost Canyon Oasis, Guadelupe Canyon, Devil Canyon and Rockhouse Canyon are all found within this wilderness. Many of these areas provide important lambing habitat for bighorn sheep. The Santa Rosa Mountains support the largest herd of Peninsular bighorn sheep in the United States. Mule deer can be found throughout the coniferous forests, which grow along the higher elevations of the range. Great horned owls, prairie falcons and golden eagles nest and forage throughout the entire wilderness. Reptiles, including frogs, toads and the desert slender salamander also live in this desert setting.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>History</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><span id=\"cke_bm_308S\" style=\"display: none;\">&nbsp;</span><img alt=\"Martinez Canyon Rockhouse, also called Jack Miller's cabin, in the Santa Rosa Wilderness.

Direct evidence links the tribe to this area for at least 3,000 years. Within the Santa Rosas are sacred sites, such as the peak of the Santa Rosa Mountain and Tahquitz Peak, and landscape features which are of great importance to Cahuilla history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within the mountain range, Cahulla villages were generally located in or near the mouth of a canyon or in a valley, and in some instances there were both summer and winter villages with the former being at higher elevations and the latter closer to the valley floor. A network of trails connect village sites, campsites, and other areas of importance. Cahuilla lived in the Santa Rosas until the late 19th century, by which time most Cahuilla had moved to nearby reservations or the Coachella Valley, and contemporary Cahuilla have strong feelings and concern for their ancestral homeland.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>he Santa Rosas have great heritage value to the Cahuilla and many sites are of National Register quality.

Linking Spain's colonial capital at Mexico City to its northern frontier in distant New Mexico, the route spans three centuries, two countries, and 1,600 miles. It was part of Spain's Camino Real Intercontinental - a global network of roads and maritime routes. </p><p>El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro was blazed atop a network of footpaths that connected Mexico's ancient cultures with the equally ancient cultures of the interior West. Starting in Mexico City, the frontier wagon road brought settlers into today's New Mexico. Once travelers crossed the arid lands above Ciudad Chihuahua, they followed the wide Rio Grande Valley north into New Mexico. Many of the historic parajes (campsites) and early settlements created by the Spanish colonists became today's modern cities in the Rio Grande Valley. </p> <p>In the United States, the trail stretched from the El Paso area in Texas, through Las Cruces, Socorro, Belen, Albuquerque, and Santa Fe to Ohkay Owingeh (San Juan Pueblo), the first Spanish capital in New Mexico. In Mexico, the historic road runs through Chihuahua, Durango, Zacatecas, San Luis Potos?, Aguascalientes, Guanajuato, and Quer?taro to Mexico City. </p> <p>Today, the trail corridor nurtures a lively exchange of ideas, customs, and language between Mexico and the American Southwest.</p><h2>El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro National Historic Trail Partnership</h2><p>Our national historic trails commemorate events and processes that shaped our Nation. While it is possible to follow the general route of El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro today on modern highways in New Mexico and Texas, many miles of the Trail cross private lands and many of the most significant trail sites are privately owned or managed by tribal, state, or municipal agencies. We work closely with the National Park Service (www.nps.gov/elca) to administer the trail and with the Camino Real de Tierra Adentro Trail Association (CARTA) (www.caminorealcarta.org) to develop volunteer opportunities and projects along the trail. Contact our many partners for information about the trail and opportunities to visit trail sites.</p><h2>Respect the Trail</h2><p>El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro runs through the heart of the Rio Grande Valley. The historic road was added to our National Trails System in 2000 as El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro National Historic Trail. The trail is administered jointly by the Bureau of Land Management and the National Park Service. These agencies work in close partnership with El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro Trail Association (CARTA), the Native Americans whose ancestors first encountered the Spanish colonists, and a large network of state, county, and municipal governmental agencies, private landowners, nonprofit heritage conservation groups, and many others. Trail sites are in private, municipal, tribal, federal or state ownership. Please ask for permission before visiting any trail sites on private lands and check with public sites for visiting hours and regulations.</p><h2>Places To Go</h2><p>There are many places of history and commemoration on El Camino Real for you to visit.

The Spanish outpost of Santa Fe, New Mexico was founded in the early 1600s and the pueblo of Los Angeles, California was founded in 1781. But it was not until 1829 when Santa Fe merchant Antonio Armijo led 60 men and 100 pack mules northward on the trails blazed by native peoples that a suitable land passage between these colonies was established. Armijo’s mules carried woolen goods for trade in California. On the return trip, Armijo backtracked along the route Spanish padres Dominguez and Escalante recorded as they returned to Santa Fe from southern Utah more than 50 years earlier. He and his men drove mules, horses, and donkeys obtained in California for trade in New Mexico. Some of the several Old Spanish Trail trade routes were eventually replaced by wagon roads, and many portions of the routes remain today in state highway transportation networks.\n \nThe Old Spanish Trail was designated by Congress as a National Historic Trail in December 2002. By memorandum from the Secretary of the Interior, the Old Spanish National Historic Trail is jointly administered by the BLM and the National Park Service, working in partnership with other federal, state, and local government agencies, as well as private landowners who manage or own lands along the trail route.", "RecAreaDirections": "Please check map for directions.", "State": "NM", "BLMRecURL": "https://www.blm.gov/visit/search-details/14617/2" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -105.846635299999946, 36.203442780000046 ] } },

Robert Stuart’s discovery of South Pass in October 1812 gave hope that a practical overland route to the Pacific (the route Lewis and Clark searched for but failed to find) did exist. <br><br> By 1824, South Pass was in annual use by mountain men and trappers engaged in the Rocky Mountain Fur Trade. Soon trappers discovered connections that linked South Pass with the Snake and Columbia rivers and with the Hudson’s Bay Company holdings of the Pacific Northwest. <br> <br> Some 150,000 pioneers went west between the years of 1849 and 1852. By the mid-1850s, stage coaches and freight wagons were regular users of the California, Mormon Pioneer and Oregon trails, rolling both east and west through South Pass. For 19 months in 1860-61, the riders of the Pony Express transcontinental mail service thundered through the pass on an incredible schedule covering 2,000 miles from St. Joseph, Missouri, to San Francisco, California, in 10 days or less. <br><br> Historians estimate that some 500,000 pioneers “went westering” along the South Pass trail system before the great overland wagon train migrations slowed down with the completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1869. About 80,000 were headed for the Willamette Valley in Oregon. Some 70,000 Mormons had the Great Salt Lake region as their destination. Most of the remaining 350,000 were bound for California with just a few headed for intermediate destinations. Of those that started the journey, one in 10 would not complete it. Thousands would die along the way, mostly from accidents, cholera and other diseases. Some would simply get to their destination and turn back.

Accessible by only a few back roads, this remote region of mountains and seascapes is also known as California's Lost Coast. </p> \n\n<p>The King Range's Douglas fir-covered peaks attract hikers, hunters, and campers, while the coast beckons to surfers, anglers, beachcombers, and many others. World-class mountain bike trails, and 42,585 acres of coastal wilderness are two of the highlights of this incredibly unique area. </p> \n\n<p>The King Range NCA contains over 80 miles of hiking trails spanning from the beach to the highest peaks. Most of the upland trails are strenuous due to the steep rugged nature of the area. In addition to mileage, pay attention to the elevation changes listed in the trail descriptions. A number of connector trails allow for loop hikes.</p>\n\n<p>The backcountry was designated as official wilderness on October 17, 2006 and the BLM manages it accordingly, so expect no facilities and minimal signing on trails.

Walkara was a skilled hunter and horseman he was nomadic and traveled over great distance, from Utah to California, often utilizing the nearby Old Spanish Trail. Able to speak numerous languages, he was well respected by whomever meant him. He proved to be a very skilled negotiator and helped negotiate peace between Utah settlers and Native Americans in 1853.

His band of warriors escaped from California traveling across the Mojave Desert, it is believed he hid out near the Springs in the Kingston Mountains before pushing the horses east for sale to travelers on the Old Spanish Trail, settlers in Utah and the military.

By 1869, more than a quarter of a million people crossed the plains and mountains heading to the West to find gold and claim free land.\n \nThe California Trail offered several paths to the West Coast and California. One of the primary routes ran through South Pass, Wyoming, which then led California-bound pioneers through southeast Idaho.  Another route led to Salt Lake City and then northward to Idaho to rejoin the main trail at the City of Rocks near Granite Pass.\n\nBy the 1860s, freight and mail companies, military expeditions, new settlements and trading stations, and thousands of travelers headed in all directions had transformed the California Trail into a road.  But, in 1869, the Union Pacific Railroad was connected with the Central Pacific Railroad at Promontory Point in northern Utah, making it possible to travel across the nation by rail   ushering in a new era in transportation and heralding the end of long-distance travel by wagon through the West. \n\n", "RecAreaDirections": "Learn more: http://www.nps.gov/cali/planyourvisit/directions.htm.", "State": "ID", "BLMRecURL": "https://www.blm.gov/visit/search-details/14985/2" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -113.244722199999956, 42.553888890000053 ] } },

It stretches from Wallowa Lake, Oregon, across Idaho to the Bear Paw National Historic Trail in Chinook, Montana.\r\n\r\nBefore and after Lewis and Clark, the Nez Perce homeland extended throughout central Idaho, northeast Oregon and southeast Washington. Here, the Nez Perce hunted, fished, collected camas and biscuitroot, and raised their children passing on knowledge acquired over millennia.\r\n\r\nAs fur trappers, traders, settlers, soldiers, missionaries, and farmers moved into or through the area, the Nez Perce and their lands underwent some very big changes. Tensions increased between the Nez Perce and these new people.  Anxious to avoid conflict, the Nez Perce signed a treaty to create a large reservation encompassing their traditional homeland. After gold was discovered inside the reservation in 1863 and as miners and settlers moved in to the reservation, a new treaty reduced the original reservation by 90 percent.\r\n\r\nSome tribal leaders rejected the new treaty. In May of 1877, the U.S. government ordered the “non-treaty” Nez Perce to relocate to the new reservation by June 14. After violence erupted, Chief Joseph and other Nez Perce leaders, including Toohoolhoolzote, decided it would be better to flee to Canada than to relocate to the reduced reservation. In 1877, 750 Nez Perce—two-thirds of them women, children, the elderly and the sick and with 2,000 of their own horses—battled and eluded more than 2,000 U.S. Army soldiers and other pursuers over 1,100 miles.

The Park also offers reservoir shore access, a boat ramp, maintained road access and dispersed camping sites. Potable water and a RV dump are available on site. The reservoir is popular for boating, fishing and camping. Anglers find trout, smallmouth bass, yellow perch, and walleye throughout the year.

Just north of the recreation area's west entrance is an interpretive shelter and a hiking trail that leads to some of the Oregon Trail ruts. Centered within the historic recreation area is a 1.3-mile paved ADA walking path that follows the historic ruts with interpretive panels along the way discussing the history of the area. Milner Historic Recreation Area also offers ample opportunities for recreation, including four miles of Snake River shoreline making it the largest accessible section of public land along the river in the entire Magic Valley. Enjoying this shoreline is made easier with access to two boat ramps within the recreation area, one of which includes a kayak/canoe launch to assist in use of non-motorized watercraft. Fishing the Snake River for bass, perch, catfish, trout and carp is popular whether from boat or shore. The area's basalt cliffs and surrounding sagebrush/grassland are a year-round haven for songbirds, waterfowl, upland birds, rabbits, and reptiles. Mule deer can often be seen along the tree lines and near the river. Scattered through the historic recreation area are 26 campsites with moderate development such as fire rings, picnic tables and vault toilets located nearby.

Free dispersed camping at Bridger Jack Mesa is limited to designated sites only.  In other areas please limit dispersed camping to previously disturbed sites.<p>  \r\nAlteration of rock surfaces and removal or vegetation is prohibited. Several popular climbs can only be reached by crossing private land. Please use existing trails and respect private land signs and fences. Climbing on petroglyphs is unlawful and destructive. Please Respect and Protect cultural resources.<p>\r\n<strong>See Mountain Project for climbing beta / route information https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105716763/indian-creek </strong><p>Camping: Numerous campgrounds in the vicinity.

Wet sandstone will erode much faster, widening cracks and leaving rope grooves. More importantly, climbing on wet sandstone weakens anchors and has been linked to cams failing. Protect and conserve scarce desert water sources. Camp at least 300 feet from isolated water sources to allow for wildlife access. Leave gates open or closed as you find them. Beware of rattlesnakes.<p>\r\nWeather Information and Tips<p>\r\nIt is extremely hot in the summer (triple digits) and cold in the winter with snow at higher elevations. The terrain can be sandy or forested, can contain copious amounts of slick rock or clay, and ranges from relatively flat to vertical.<p>\r\nEducational Information / Environmental Protection<p>\r\nAs you are planning your next desert adventure to climb, learn how to take care of this environment and minimize your impact. The desert environment demands some very specific minimum impact behaviors due to its unique and fragile terrain. Take care when traveling to and from the cliffs and boulders not to trample fragile cryptobiotic soil, which is a living crust that plays an important ecological role in many desert environments. Always pack out human waste, as desert soil lacks the necessary microorganisms to biodegrade it. Wait 24-48 hours to climb on sandstone following rain.<p>\r\nHistorical Information / Cultural Resource Protection<p>\r\nLeave historic sites, Native American rock art, ruins and artifacts untouched for the future. Admire rock art from a distance, but never touch it. Stay out of ruins, leave artifacts in place, and report any violations to the BLM Monticello Field Office at (435) 587-1500. Respect and Protect cultural and natural resources.  Learn more about Archaeological Site Etiquette.<p>\r\nScientific Information / Wildlife Safety<p>\r\nWhen encountering wildlife, maintain your distance and remain quiet. Teach children not to pick up, chase, or approach animals. Keep pets under control.<p>\r\nLeave No Trace / Wilderness Ethics<p>\r\nTread lightly when traveling and leave no trace of your camping. Drive and ride only on roads and trails where such travel is allowed. Hike only on established trails, on rock, or in washes. Camp at designated sites, or at previously used sites where dispersed camping is allowed. Avoid placing tents on top of vegetation. Use a camp stove instead of making a campfire.

This may break the geode into many small pieces.\r\n*Hammer and chisel or center punch:  This will open your geode with a rough or uneven edge.\r\n*Sawing:  You can cut a geode with a rock or similar saw.  Most tools with a carbide tipped blade will cut a geode. This works well if you also want to polish it.\r\n*Pipe cutter:  You can use a tool called a soil pipe cutter which uses chain with blades to cut the geode as if it were a pipe.

Bob was often called the Hermit of Marjum Pass. The government paid him to keep the pass clear of debris, as it was at the time the major east/west highway from Delta to Nevada. To earn extra spending money he trapped bobcats and coyotes, mixed poisons for the government to kill grasshoppers, and he even raised a handful of sheep. When Bob would have visitors, out of the greatness of his heart, he would offer them a glass of home brew. In 1951 Bob lost his road job when the new paved highway was built several miles to the south. Bob, then in his 70's, moved into Delta to be near a few more creature comforts. At the age of 80 when Bob passed away he was cremated and his ashes were spread at the base of the rock house he built in Marjum Pass. Please protect the Hermit's Cave for many more generations.

Dunes often reach heights of 300 feet above the desert floor, providing outstanding opportunities for recreation. A favorite place for off-highway vehicle (OHV) enthusiasts, the dunes also offer fabulous scenery, opportunities for solitude, and a home to rare plants and animals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With most of the off-road action taking place in the recreation area south of Highway 78, the open areas allow all types of vehicle recreation. Limited areas surround the dunes require vehicles to travel on designated routes. Closed areas prohibit motorized vehicle use entirely. Information and maps for all of these areas are available at the ranger stations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The North Algodones Dunes Wilderness offers a tranquil alternative to the fast-paced action of the main dunes. This wilderness encompasses more than 26,000 acres, with the largest and tallest dunes located in the central area. Visitors are welcome to walk or ride horses in this remote area. The wilderness is closed to all vehicles and mechanized use.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Fees and Permits</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Permits are required from October 1 through April 15 each year.

It is approximately 70 miles north of Tucson and 100 miles southeast of Phoenix. The area includes approximately 5 river miles on public land administered by the Bureau of Land Management that is open to public recreational use. The area includes two minimally developed sites that provide access from SR77 to the Gila River for river related recreation, such as wildlife viewing, picnicking, camping, fishing and small craft river floating in a scenic Sonoran desert canyon landscape. The Shores and Christmas recreation sites offer site roads off the highway, gravel parking, toilets and primitive picnic camping units. The sites are available at no cost on a first come first served basis. Wildlife Viewing: The Gila River riparian area and upland canyon habitats provide habitat for a variety of wildlife, including resident and migratory avian species, small mammals, reptiles and insects. The recreation sites is largely natural habitat, and some wildlife may present a hazard, such as rattlesnakes. Picnicking, Camping: Primitive sites with parking and a fire ring are available. Bring your own table, cooking stove and site furnishings. The sites are not suitable for large motor homes or RV trailers due to narrow clearance and maneuvering space. Fishing: Warm water fish (channel catfish and carp, as well as some large flathead catfish and largemouth bass) may be found in this section of the Gila River. River Floating: The Gila River can be accessed for floating at the Christmas and Shores sites, with a downriver take-out at the Town of Winkelman River Park. River flows are controlled by releases from the Coolidge Dam for agricultural irrigation in the Casa Grande-Coolidge area, and are typically suitable for small craft river floating (such as inflatable kayaks, canoes and tubes) from May through October when flows are over 300 cubic feet per second (cfs) at the USGS Gila river Below Coolidge Dam stream gage. CAUTION RIVER FLOATERS: At high flows, 600 cfs or greater, the river may be at bankfull, and the current runs fast making maneuvering float craft extremely challenging and difficult or impossible to avoid navigation hazards. Hazards that may be encountered include tight river turns, restricted sight distance, debris deposits, tree branches overhanging the stream, fallen trees across the channel, dense vegetation along the riverbanks, and steep terrain. Other hazards include a fence across the river upstream between the Christmas and Shores sites. Accessibility: The toilets/restrooms are wheelchair accessible. The picnic/camping sites and foot paths may have uneven ground surfaces, loose soils, and steep slopes and other obstructions that present barriers for the mobility impaired. Permits: A permit is not required for private, non-commercial use of the sites. Use of public lands in connection with commercial recreational use requires a BLM Special Recreation Permit. Non-BLM Land: The Gila River crosses private and Arizona State Trust land. Please respect private property rights by not stopping on private land without permission and obtain a permit from the Arizona State Land Department for use of State Trust lands. A valid Arizona Game and Fish Department license is required for hunting or fishing. Prohibited Activities: Target shooting and fireworks are not allowed.

The river continues through state, private and Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge land for a total of 344 miles before emptying into the Yukon River about halfway between Fort Yukon and Beaver.</p><p>Birch Creek Wild and Scenic River offers outstanding recreation opportunities for float boat use for those experienced with canoe, kayak, or raft. Float trips usually take about 50 hours of actual water time to travel the 110 river miles between BLM's put-in and take-out waysides, both located on the Steese Highway. A leisurely trip requires 7 to 10 days. The water is predominately Class I, but there are some Class II and Class III areas.</p><p>Although visited primarily in summer, Birch Creek Wild and Scenic River offers many winter activities for those wanting a primitive backcountry experience. Snowmobiling along the creek is popular in March and April as the days get longer and temperatures start to rise. For a few days each February, the Yukon Quest International Sled Dog Race between Fairbanks and Whitehorse makes portions of Birch Creek busy with dog teams and mushers. Dog mushing, trapping, and cross-country skiing are popular winter activities along the frozen river.</p><p><h2>Monitoring River Levels</h2>A new stream gauge has been installed on Birch Creek near the put-in at the Upper Birch Creek Wayside at Milepost 94 Steese Highway. Using GOES satellite telemetry, water stage, water temperature, air temperature, cumulative precipitation and water turbidity are recorded at 15-minute intervals. Current observations are available on the National Weather Service?s Hydrometeorological Automated Data System (HADS) website (https://hads.ncep.noaa.gov/charts/AK.shtml).</p>   <p> To view the data, find station BCTA2 (Birch Creek above Twelvemile Creek) in the list, select a time interval, and press \"Decoded Data\" to view the tables and graphs of observations. For those interested in floating Birch Creek, look at the River Height (HG) data for current river stage conditions.</p> <p>Stage of less than 1.0 feet is very low flow, meaning difficult floating, especially for rafts. Stage of 2 feet is moderate flow --good float conditions. Stage of 3 to 3.5 feet or above is considered high water; be prepared for fast current, floating logs, flooded campsites, and potentially dangerous conditions.</p>", "RecAreaDirections": "<p>STARTING YOUR RIVER TRIP:  To reach Birch Creek, take the Steese Highway from Fairbanks to milepost 94, where a 0.2-mile gravel road leads down to the Upper Birch Creek Wayside.

This area has hundreds of archaeological sites that are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.<p> <span style=\"font-weight : bold;\"> NOTE: Collection or disturbance of any historic or prehistoric remains is against the law. </span> <p> <span style=\"font-weight : bold;\"> Vegetation </span> <p> Vegetation ranges from arctic tundra to spruce-poplar forests. Grasses, sedges and forbs grow on the highest, most exposed slopes and above the brush line. Willows grow on moist lowland sites and in the many brushy draws draining the side slopes. <p> Dwarf birch occupies drier sites with well-drained soils. Alder grows on steep slopes of hillsides and canyon walls. Forests of white and black spruce grow in small pockets along the river, and on some hillsides below an elevation of 3,200 feet. You will find open spruce-poplar forests on lowland sites along the river and on some mid-slope hillsides. <p> Understory plants are varied and abundant. Fireweed, bistort, rose, mountain avens, burnet, and shrubby cinquefoil are just some of the many plants in the area. In August, many people travel to Tangle Lakes to pick blueberries. Other harvestable berries in the Delta River area include crowberry, alpine bearberry, cranberry and red currant. <p> <span style=\"font-weight : bold;\"> Wildlife </span> <p> Wildlife provides opportunities for hunting, trapping, photography and viewing. Hunters seek moose, caribou, bear, Dall sheep, ptarmigan, waterfowl and snowshoe hare. Trappers harvest beaver, fox, wolf, marten, lynx, wolverine, otter, muskrat and mink. <p> Of the 110 species of birds identified in this area, most are summer residents (May to September). Nesting bald eagles can be observed from Tangle Lakes to the lower Delta River during the summers. <p> Wildlife viewing is best in the early morning. <p> <span style=\"font-weight : bold;\"> Fish </span> <p> Tangle Lakes and the Delta River contain grayling, round whitefish, lake trout, burbot and longnose suckers. Most fishing is for grayling, but good lake trout fishing is available in late winter and early spring. <p> Salmon are not found in the Delta River due to the 15-foot-high falls and the heavy silt load entering from Eureka Creek. <p> You can purchase an Alaska fishing license and view sport fishing regulations online at the <a href=\"http://www.adfg.state.ak.us\"> Alaska Department of Fish and Game </a> website or buy in person from license agents throughout the state, including stores in Glennallen, Delta Junction and Tok.", "RecAreaDirections": "Lower Tangle Lakes and Upper Delta River trip: Put-in is at Tangle Lakes Campground (MP 21 Denali Highway) and take out is north of Phelan Creek (MP 212 Righardson Highway).
